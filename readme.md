# Smart Contact Manager

Developed with Spring Boot, Smart Contact Manager (SCM) is an all-inclusive contact management tool. With features like email-based account authentication, social login integration (Google and GitHub) and cloud storage for contact photos, the project provides a safe and easy-to-use platform for maintaining contacts. SCM gives users the ability to add, edit, remove and search contacts. It also offers sophisticated capabilities like the ability to compose emails directly (with attachments) and export contact information to Excel and PDF files.
